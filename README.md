# APT-Project

In this APT-Project there are two main tasks: 

Task 1 is about designing a DL classifier (a.k.a target model) to classify APT dataset. Then using mia, membership inference attack 
is carried out against target model. In apt.py file, all three models, i.e., target model, shadow models and attack model are merged in terms 
of a single pipeline. 

Whereas, Task 2 (main contribution of the APT project) is about designing a sequential model for the identification of adversarial and normal sequences.
