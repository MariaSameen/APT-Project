# APT-Project

In this APT-Project, a DL classifier (a.k.a target model) is designed to classify APT dataset. Then using mia, membership inference attack 
is carried out against target model. In apt.py file, all three models, i.e., target model, shadow models and attack model are merged in terms 
of a single pipeline.
